# TrustMed

**TrustMed** is a blockchain-based healthcare platform designed to ensure data integrity and patient trust. This repository contains the frontend application, engineered with a focus on security, scalability, and modern web standards.

## ⚡ Tech Stack

This project utilizes a bleeding-edge stack to ensure performance and longevity:

### 🎨 Frontend (Patient & Doctor Portals)
- **Framework:** [Next.js 16](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
- **Core:** [React 19](https://react.dev/)
- **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS 4](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Language:** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **State/Validation:** React Hook Form + Zod

### ⚙️ Backend (Core, HMS & Connector)
- **Framework:** [NestJS 11](https://nestjs.com/)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL / MySQL (via TypeORM)
- **Architecture:** Microservices with shared DTOs
- **Validation:** class-validator + class-transformer



## 🏗 System Architecture

The repository is structured into three logical domains:

1.  **Core Platform (`apps/core-*`)**: The central authority managing DIDs and Consent.
2.  **Hospital System (`apps/hms-*`)**: A simulated, standalone hospital environment with its own private database.
3.  **The Bridge (`apps/connector-node`)**: A background service that polls the HMS and securely transmits records to the Core via API.
